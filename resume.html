<h3 align="center">WORK EXPERIENCE</h3>
<p align="center">After receiving my B.A., I worked for Coopers & Lybrand proofing corporate and personal tax returns. Then I moved to International Sports Propteries (1980) Inc. (ISPI) where I was promoted over time from receptionist to editor of several ISPI publications. I assigned, proofed, and wrote articles as well as scheduled upcoming issues of various publications, including: <em>CFL Illustrated</em>; <em>The (Toronto Maple) Leafs Magazine</em>; and <em>The (Winnipeg) Jets Magazine</em>.</p>
<p align="center">I also edited publications for The Royal Agricultural Winter Fair; Ontario Place and The Forum; Canada's Wonderland and Kingswood Music Theatre.</p>
<p align="center">I left ISPI to attend law school. After being called to the Bar, I practiced for a brief time, primarily in the area of enternatinment law as a sole proprietor. I no longer practise law and do not provide legal advice, legal research or legal services. My focus has been on writing for publications.</p>

The <em>Manual</em> aims to provide an overview in straightforward language of basic legislative and other information on a national basis that is relevant to businesses in 29 areas of law and related topics.</p>
